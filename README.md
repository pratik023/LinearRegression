# LinearRegression
#### Linear Regression in Python - Scikit and Scratch

## 1. Simple Linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression establishes relation between two variables. One is called as a 'dependent variable' and the other is called as 'independent varible'. </br>
The dependent variable is used to predict the value of independent variable. </br>
The model is represented as: y = mx + c </br>
where, y - independent variable
       x - dependent variable
       c - y_intercept (i.e. value of y when x=0)

#### Scikit Implementation
This is a very basic implementation of Simple Linear Regression for beginners. It includes reading a dataset and using it to build a model
This model is then used to predict outcome for test point. </br>
It involves some visualization of data and the best fit line.

#### Scratch Implementation

This code unfolds the logic behind the working of Simple Linear Regression. The scikit code is very abstract, easy to implement for beginners but doesn't give enough idea about what's happening at the backend.  </br>
This code implements Linear Regression using the 'Gradient Descent Approach' for updating the weights.
All the operations are done in the form of matrix multiplications.</br>
It also has basic visualizations of data and the best fit line.
